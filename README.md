# Hey there! 
I'm Fernando, a fresher coding enthusiast that loves turning coffee into code, non-stop talking about very specific topics, making grotesque grammatical errors, and 4 total hours of sleep a day!
<br><i>Don't give me coffee, seriously.</i>

I'm 20y old and ongoing my master level in Computer Inteligence! (But mainly focused on graphics/computer vision)
<br>Brazilian guy fluent in english with a bri'ish accent (that's what some people say ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯) and trying to shift from web to software dev. _What a decadence_
<!--
EMOTICONS >>>>> EMOJIS 
You really oppened this readme file? Well, at least now you know that I like easter eggs! 
(Also, this shrug looks completely stupid in the text editor mode (；′⌒`) )
-->

Hobbies?
<br>Uhh... Kerbal Space Program? Helldivers 2? (Modded) Minecraft? _Any other game involving space or technical things?_
<br>I like LEGOs too.

## My stack
- I'm repenting on learning JavaScript,
- I automated every single boring and repetitive job I ever had with Python,
- I had the **NERVES** to learn graphics with java AWT. Loved it! ★☆☆☆☆ 
- C++ is my focus now, I've used it together with Qt framework before and tried the OpenGl Graphical API too. (It's a long-term relationship by now!)

<i>Where you expecting a better readme? I write code, not self-help books!</i>
